# MyCalendar

Author: Yohan Hmaiti

=> Developed a program that displays a calendar to the user based on the current date or the date the user inputs. 
=> Implemented graphic functionalities allowing the display of colours and shapes in C/C++. 
=> Created the option to change the year or month based on the click of arrows outside the rectangle containing the weekdays and their numbering in the current month.

=> Note: Check first if the compiler/Mingw supports the following conio.h and windows.h

// This program represents a calendar app taht allows the user to go to his desired date
// through specifying the month and year or the user can directly if no choice is entered
// go to the current date.

=> Note: The program can also Operate through using the Keyboard arrow keys in all directions!!!!!
=> Note: The user will be able to use also screen based arrows to initiate changes

// Multiple commands that offer easy manipulation and colour use are implemented for a better
// user experience and easy access/walkthrough of the calendar.

=> Note: the calendar showcases the month/year/date and the days of the week

// the program uses the COORD struct that consists of two corrdinates x and y of type SHORT
